"# DemoLoggingSpringBoot" 

The Logging Demo is in student-system-tiles folder. I reused the project in my training phase.

Configuration for Log4j2 is in src/main/resources/log4j2-spring.xml
Configuration for Logback is in src/main/resources/logback.xml

If not use the configuration in classpath, use `logging.config` property in `application.properties` to specific the configuration file path.
